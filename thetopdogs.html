                    <p>“That has definitely been a conscious effort, to really try to involve the stakeholders and also the folks who are getting affected by decisions in the conversation. It's not always easy to do when you are making quick decisions on a day to day basis, but once we start thinking about major overarching issues, we want to make sure that all the groups that are going to be affected by the decisions are in these conversations. <b>Frankly we don't always remember to do that,</b> but I think that's an important element of the decision making process”</p>

                    <p>“I've seen various of these, if you will: events or incidents, when students have sorted taken up matters and pushed the dialogue.  <b>Look—There's no administrator who is a big fan of these kinds of disruptions, and I think often it's a little bit unfortunate because the audience, for instance in that case alumni with the president, had come for very specific purposes.</b> They were celebrating, and thus it might have not been the right venue to insert into that conversation. That said, I have to admit that it did push forward some of the conversation, though not in the way I would have necessarily have liked to see. At the time, I felt a little like, 'I wish folks would have come directly to us,' but then again, we didn't have those sorts of connections… I would encourage students to think, 'what are the productive venues to have these conversations,' because when a student writes to me to talk about something, I almost say yes.”</p>

                    <p><b>“I think it's a matter of reminding ourselves that whenever we take an action, that all the stakeholders—not just students, not just faculty—but also the staff must be heard.</b> The difficult part of all of this, is that many of the things we're dealing with now, are culture changes. When we talk about things like harassment, we talk about things like gender issues, and racial issues, ect., and these are difficult, societal problems. We really have to think all the time of who we need to bring to the table to have these discussions, and we don't always remember. So I think part of the Duke community response to things has to be, ‘how do we make these discussions more inclusive?’ Honestly, the leadership is part of it, but that also has to emerge from the grassroots. <b>We're not always perfect at getting these done.”</b></p>

                    <p><b>“Something that is totally different that can be both exciting and challenge is when there is a major student protest.</b> I've been here 22 years, I've seen lots... so, it's recognizing, acknowledging, the creativity that students often bring when they are in protest, and at the same time, I have my role as vice president with responsibility for regulations and ways of running a university. Sometimes, those are challenging… <b>I think I constantly try to remind myself that I don't want that to create a situation where I'm out of touch with students who sometimes bring a very different generation's perspective.</b> So, constantly trying to remind myself of that.”</p>

                    <p>“We would have an annual awards dinner in February. It started out with 30 or 40 people. Now, it has about 350 people. Housekeepers, ground keepers, athletes, undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, staff, Durham residents. <b>It is probably the only Duke gathering of that type that is truly representative of everybody.</b> That is again this February, we give out awards to undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty/staff, and Durham residents. Dr. Cook, who was living in Atlanta, would come up with his wife every year, and he passed away about two years ago. His wife still comes. That is something that I am very proud of.”</p>

                    <p>“There's still lots of issues for us to work on as a university, so the kinds of things that get protested have changed. A lot of subtle bias, subtle but important inequities, as opposed to obvious and blatant sexism, racism, homophobia. <b>As we live in a world where racism and bias is subtle but just as powerful, just as important as overt racism.”</b></p>

                    <p>“I can't say that we are always good at getting voices from every perspective that there really is. <b>Often, we default to the elected leaders, the student representatives. we are operating on the premise that these students were elected to represent the student voice, therefore there is legitimacy by consulting with them regularly.</b> Unfortunately, that still means that only a handful of voices tend to be part of the conversation. It's really difficult to have a lot of voices involved in any particular project. It just gets a bit unruly in some ways. I don't know if we do the best job of getting voices from all perspectives, but we hope that the elected leaders represent those voices well.”</p>

                    <p>“The goals are often very similar if not the same. <b>What differs often is the timeline, students usually operate on a much shorter timeline than administrators tend to gravitate towards.</b> As well as, reality checks. Administrators tend to see those more prominently than students. The conversation will normally yield whether or not that reality check is a true reality check and whether that idea is untenable or no, it has a workaround. I've seen it go both directions. You never know at the beginning. Often, the aspirations are the same. I think sometimes, we do a great job of involving the student voice, and I think sometimes we do a very poor job of it. I can't say there's any rhyme or reason as to why it happens one way or the other… <b>It's rarely that there's a lack of respect for students or a lack of regard for their voice. It's often a lack of recognition that this is one where their voice is needed.”</b></p>

                    <p>“I think one thing students learn as they get involved in these types of things, <b>it's always important to know where a decision lies.</b> Sometimes, it's not always as obvious as you might think it is. I think that's always an important thing in any sort of situation, when it comes down to it, is who gets to make this decision?”</p>

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>Despite all of their caricatures of complicity and racism, we have learned that university administrators share similar objectives with students and workers—they are against racism, they are in favor of equity. They face, however, the inescapable condition of not getting everyone in the room. As mentioned my Provost Kornbluth, they often “forget to remember” in the midst of all the other events that require immediate attention. Many of the administrators, moreover, believe that there are proper institutional channels available and accessible to both students and workers, and feel disrespected when the former chooses protest instead of dialogue. In sum, there is a recognition among them that they are a human enterprise—bound to make mistakes and consequently accountable for them. A rejoinder they offer, however, to the criticism that they are too slow to respond to issues, is that they’re restricted by the reality of running a university—a reality misunderstood and not properly considered by student activists and workers.
