                    <p>"A lot of students are quite racist. <b>They see us as beneath them.</b> It’s not just the white students either—it’s everyone, the whites, the asians, even our own culture—the black kids are against us. We do nothing but help you try to go through college as easy as possible. They’ll look down on us like you’re nothing but the hired help.  But if we weren’t here, how are you going to survive? Who’s going to cook for you, who’s going to clean your bathrooms, who’s going to make sure your common rooms are nice so you have somewhere to study? Whos going to make sure the libraries are nice? What are you going to do for yourself?"</p>
                    <p>"If it’s not the students being racist, it’s the higher ups being racist... I’ve had an incident where I was just walking to the clinic... I’m just standing there and a guy is like, 'Excuse me you’re in my way.' I’m like, there’s grass on the other side, and they’re doing construction. Well then, 'Move.' I’m like, 'But sir, you have all this sidewalk.' He says, 'Well, I don’t want to move from where I’m from, so you go on the other side.' I’m like, 'What gives you the right to tell me this?' He says, 'Because I’m better than you.' I said, 'What makes you better than me?' And he says, 'Everything,' bumps me, then walks away. I’m like… apparently, everything you have is better than mine. Because I don’t wake up every day like you to come to work, just like you do, to make money to pay bills for my life, just like you. <b>Our goals are all the same, we were just blessed differently."</b></p>
                    <p>"I don't really feel connected to Duke as a whole. How they see us isn't how they would want to see us. A lot of the managers and supervisors are like, "Well... my employee." <b>We have names, we have kids, we have family, as have birthdays. We aren't just another employee.</b> At the end of the day you're just another employee, because there are other people above you. It's this weird pyramid where it's like there's always someone above another, and it's just always looking down, trying to bully on someone below them. <b>I don't really feel connected as a whole because I don't want to feel a part of that structure.</b>"</p>
