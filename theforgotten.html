                    <p>“A lot of students are quite racist. <b>They see us as beneath them.</b> It’s not just the white students either—it’s everyone, the whites, the asians, even our own culture—the black kids are against us. We do nothing but help you try to go through college as easy as possible. They’ll look down on us like you’re nothing but the hired help.  But if we weren’t here, how are you going to survive? Who’s going to cook for you, who’s going to clean your bathrooms, who’s going to make sure your common rooms are nice so you have somewhere to study? Whos going to make sure the libraries are nice? What are you going to do for yourself?”</p>

                    <p>“If it’s not the students being racist, it’s the higher ups being racist... I’ve had an incident where I was just walking to the clinic... I’m just standing there and a guy is like, 'Excuse me you’re in my way.' I’m like, there’s grass on the other side, and they’re doing construction. Well then, 'Move.' I’m like, 'But sir, you have all this sidewalk.' He says, 'Well, I don’t want to move from where I’m from, so you go on the other side.' I’m like, 'What gives you the right to tell me this?' He says, 'Because I’m better than you.' I said, 'What makes you better than me?' And he says, 'Everything,' bumps me, then walks away. I’m like… apparently, everything you have is better than mine. Because I don’t wake up every day like you to come to work, just like you do, to make money to pay bills for my life, just like you. <b>Our goals are all the same, we were just blessed differently.”</b></p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>“I don't really feel connected to Duke as a whole. How they see us isn't how they would want to see us. A lot of the managers and supervisors are like, "Well... my employee." <b>We have names, we have kids, we have family, as have birthdays. We aren't just another employee.</b> At the end of the day you're just another employee, because there are other people above you. It's this weird pyramid where it's like there's always someone above another, and it's just always looking down, trying to bully on someone below them. <b>I don't really feel connected as a whole because I don't want to feel a part of that structure.”</b></p>

                    <p><b>“I say a lot of times [the administration] makes decisions and then come to us after they are already made.</b> Like our schedule change— when they switched our schedules to work on the weekends and seven days in a row without overtime—it was really unfair and our voices weren't heard on that issue. And it wasn't a great move I don't think, for us, nor for the cleaning up the building. So I think it took away from our ability to keep it really clean. I think it made the matter worse… the union signed off on it, before they discussed it with us …  I pay my union dues and I give them my opinions. The union is a good thing to have, but they don't always work in our favor. All in all, I will say that the union is a great thing. But, you know, it has its issues, like everything else.”</p>

                    <p><b>“I think the students are very powerful. I do know of situations where employees have lost their jobs and then were issued their jobs back because students were getting behind them.</b> So it's definitely—students have a lot of power. When I worked in GA, we had one student who complained that the elevator was too noisy, and in the next morning, the elevator, the elevator couldn’t be operated after nine o’ clock—so students really have power.”</p>

                    <p>“People were complaining about pay—which is decent—but pay could always be better. I think when they come up with an idea, they should run it by us before they make a decision. That would be helpful, just to get our input. <b>I mean, we live it and we do it and we experience it, so we should have impact on the decisions they make that they might not see.”</b></p>

                    <p>“I have to tell you, everyone is not alike. <b>I talk to some of my co-workers every day—I do realize ya'll are the power at the university...</b> This situation we got about three months ago, when they were going to change our shifts and all, it was y’all that pulled us out of this mess. The students alliance did it. I try to tell all of my co-workers, that's who you want to be friends with. You've got some knuckleheads, and I've got them that they hate me because I'm in the news too much, I'm doing interviews.”</p>

                    <p><b>“It's the power structure at the university, it's the students. Most of the time, they back us down. Our union? It stinks.</b> It won't do nothing for us, and I tell all the members, why do you pay that money? They don't do nothing for you. I tell them, if it weren't for the students, the union are all up in there lying to us, we need three signatures to make the contract legit. We get three signatures, and I say, that's a legit contract there, and the director says, 'We movin' on.' I think all my coworkers know now, and I say 80% of them give them more respect as it is.”</p>

                    <p>“Let me put it to you like this: Y’all got most of the credit for stopping this situation. The other part was because I went to the top dogs, Kavanaugh, President Price. When I get upset, I don't talk this nice. I speak what's on my mind. I start using Facebook as my defense, my first statement on Facebook is 'With the injustice going on at Duke University for the housekeeping, why haven't we heard from the Board of Trustees, President Price, and the Alumni Association?' I've got most of them as my friends on there, so I know they saw. I start getting: 'Calm down, Oscar. It's going to be alright.'”</p>

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>Our interviews with the forgotten help affirm our belief that their voices have become stolen—stolen through unclear, uneffective institutional channels, collective action problems, and patronization tinged with racism. To begin, most workers have lost faith in—or are unaware of—the established channels available to voice their concerns. As a result, many believe that students are best equipped to carry out their concerns to the administration. Moreover, unlike students and administrators who can easily centralize behind a common agenda, workers cannot. They are fragmented by geography, profession, and self-interest. Even among unions, such as the one on East campus, many feel as though their voices are not properly represented. A select few, however, do possess direct access to administrators, revealing an inequality of access and the tendency of the university to tokenize a few workers for the sake of legitimizing their stated concern for all workers. Lastly, these workers, many of whom are local people of color who've walked the halls of the university for much longer than most students, face blatant racism from the student body as well as from the administration, perpetuating an internalization of expendability and marginalization that feeds into their disempowerment.
