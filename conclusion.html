        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <div class="korstadiananalysis">
            <p>Through the interviews that were gathered from the workers, the students, and the administrators, we learned that the voices of the former are not stolen by a singular entity. Instead, it is a product of both micro macro level issues that affect all domains of Duke’s community. Below, we summarize three, main themes that we drew from the narratives:</p>
            <p><b>Collective Action:</b> The first theme is <b>collective action</b>. Collective action, or the power of a collective and united voice, is an important component in enacting change. As aforementioned, the working community of Duke is fragmented by geography, profession, and self-interest. The inability and unwillingness to centralize behind a singular, representative voice has been detrimental in getting their concerns unilaterally heard by administrators. What results is an administration is often frustrated by their inability to “get every person in the room” and a working community that is dependent on better organized students to properly channel their objectives.</p>
            <p><b>Respect:</b> Another theme is one of <b>respect</b>. The narratives of the workers suggests a deficit of respect—through racism and marginalization—from both students and administration. The general sentiment, however, is that students respect workers more; students have advocated for workers’ rights for generations, whereas the administration has pursued policies that have painted their workers as expendable. On the other hand, both the students and administration believe they are not receiving due respect from one another; students believe their perspectives are not respectfully heard, whereas the administration views that they are disrespectfully voiced. This belief of disrespect is further exacerbated by misunderstandings from both sides.</p>
            <p><b>Agency:</b> Lastly, workers’ voices often lack <b>agency.</b> The administration are slow to pursue adequate change, as they are confined by institutional restrictions, reality, and the the status-quo. As a result, they often perceive certain obstacles relating to race and justice to be insurmountable. Workers are another group facing the status-quo. They lack a sense of efficacy because they have been working in the same institution for years, many for decades, without any substantial, tangible changes that have improved their lives. This loss of efficacy, thus, results in lack of agency over their situation. The tragedy of the status-quo does not affect students, however, noted by the understanding from both the administration and workers that students are  the ones “with power.” With every new class, comes a new perspective that isn’t beholden to the failures of the past. </p>
            <p>In light of these learnings, we offer the following recommendations. </p>
            <p><b>Incentivize Better Organization:</b> Regarding organization, both administrators and workers must better incentivize unionization, so that the latter has the opportunity to advocate for themselves. Furthermore, the administration must make the institutional channels available to both workers and students more transparent; the perception of a Kafkaesque bureaucracy incentivizes protest. Lastly, we suggest that workers take advantage of social media and its power for connection. Social networking allows students to organize so effectively, so encouraging that among the staff may allow potential for collective action.</p>
            <p><b>Promote Respect and Equity Within the Duke Community:</b> We also propose policies that address the deficit of respect. This can culminate through an orientation activity for Duke freshman that addresses the nature of working at Duke, hitting upon the tenants of racial equality and empowerment that transcends also upon other campus-wide issues. Furthermore, workers must respect other workers. To do that, the administration must not unfairly reward certain workers over others on arbitrary grounds. <br></p>
            <p><b>Provide Agency for the Working Community:</b> Lastly, students should work towards propagating a sense of agency and self-fulfillment within the working community. By working on an internal strategy aside from just the external one of advocatation, students can help equip workers to one day advocate for themselves. For administration, clearly communicating the requisites of university action (i.e. data collected by students to corroborate their need for a certain policy) will let both students and workers what is necessary for action, and that such action is properly attainable.</p>
            <p>As aforementioned, the initial objective of our project was to analyze the context of stolen voices from the people whom had it stolen—the university staff. As we delved further into our research, however, we saw that all the perspectives of the university stakeholders were necessary in deconstructing the racism and privilege that had perpetuated worker disempowerment and misunderstanding. Upon the conclusion of our research, we can see in Duke a microcosm of our nation-writ-large; our country, too, faces the marginalization people of color at the hands of collective action problems, disrespect, and agency. Thus, how we approach this issue may provide insights for our nation as well. And now emboldened with an better understanding of all the stakeholder relationships at play, we hope that Duke, as well as our country, comes one step closer towards racial justice and equity.</p>
