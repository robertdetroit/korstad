                    <p>“BSA wants to support all university policies that are intended to enhance the university and make it a better place for all Duke students, especially with regard to diversity and inclusion. Something we have to keep in mind though is we don't want those policies to flourish at the expense of black students specifically. There has been some pushback amongst students of color about the recent housing policy, and it is because... we would love the promotion of diversity and inclusion in housing... who would not... but, putting the onus of educating other students on black students within their own bedrooms is something that is a bit difficult to support. So basically, finding best ways to support the university, but also addressing the concerns of individual students is a tension that BSA always has to tread lightly.”</p>

                    <p>“In BSA's mission, we do include faculty and staff in who we address. A lot of times, it's more difficult to do because we are so focused on the student experience, but we are definitely there to listen. This semester, I spent a lot of time with staff listening to concerns about the new scheduling, like the idea of working weekends vs. the traditional schedule we had last year. Finding best ways to support staff, faculty, in terms of connecting with students, recruiting new faculty, yielding the faculty that we do have in making sure that they stay and want to be here, those are things that are all very important to BSA. <b>It takes a lot, a lot of listening.”</b></p>

                    <p>“I sat down with Dean Ashby, and I actually did a project on diversity at Duke and what that means.. <b>her biggest thing was that diversity is inherent to excellence.</b> You can't have diversity without diversity of thought, diversity of experience. <b>The reflection of what the room looks like should be a reflection of the different thoughts and experiences captured in that room, and that's just imperative to Duke growing as an institution.</b> Without different voices, the university is stagnant.”</p>

                    <p><b>“I think that the power that comes from students is collective power.</b> I think, in my position, what actually does give me power is being able to communicate with the student body and get the student body to understand an issue, to rally around an issue. To push for any issues, things like that. <b>A lot of times, I think it's a lack of communication between administration and student body, so just being there to be that liaison does affect change.”</b></p>

                    <p><b>“Administration sometimes doesn't want to meet with a student just because a lot of the meeting might just be education.</b> So, the way our student government works is that they might be more willing to meet with me. If I'm working on a specific project, then I kind of understand the way administration works.”</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>“I do think that every student should find it within themselves to care about the communities around them. Words like social activism might scare people because they might think they have to be in the streets with picket signs, that type of thing. It's a lot more simple than people might understand it to be. I think it's showing up at rallies, I think it's listening when people post these stories in the Chronicle, or in any sort of news journal. It's about reposting those things, just showing up, caring, listening. I think that those numbers really give people a voice. I think that it is something that is in the power of every Duke student. <b>We are all actually in really privileged positions as just being Duke students. Our voice carries a lot of weight, both on campus and outside of Duke. I think that if we all rallied around an idea, we can make a lot of big changes.”</b></p>

                    <p>“I think they're always willing to sit down and talk to us and be in the room with us for the most part, and there's some things where—I might not use the word uncooperative—but really much set on that “this isn't going to happen anytime soon,” so <b>it's a matter of pushing on those things</b>, and I think what fuels us through that is knowing that you are one part of a longer history of activism; there were people doing this before us and there are people are going to do this after this. So not everything is going to happen while we are here, but keep the pressure on consistently is really important. But I would say—yeah—I think they are cooperative.”</p>

                    <p>“The event happened, obviously the disruption happened, and afterwords, it was really cool. We got a really mixed reaction. So there was obviously pretty hateful, pretty racist alums who said pretty awful things to students, like 'go back to where you came from', and 'you don't belong here.’ It was really gross and awful, but also a ton of faculty reached out to us in support and said, 'Hey do you need any help?' A lot of alums sent us mails. It was really cool because a lot of alums who were involved in '68 reached out to us and said, ‘We are really proud of you,’ so that was really affirming. <b>I would walk around campus and workers would stop me and say, 'that was really cool, I'm so glad y'all did that,’ and that's exciting and affirming from the people that we wanted to really be excited about it.”</b></p>

                    <p>“It was really an uncomfortable moment and kind of a gut-check for administration, realizing how frustrated a lot of students have been with how slow a lot of things have been moving.”</p>

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>We learned that many protests and activism movements start with the students, and their collective power has the ability to call to the attention of the administration so that real change is pushed forward. Students are the most visible members of our university—they make up the heart and soul of Duke life. As a result, students are uniquely privileged members of the university whose voice holds a lot of weight. However, not every students feels it is their responsibility to better our university through social activism; afterall, they are only here for a short four years. However, motivated student leaders who are able to leverage the voices of the students play a crucial role in raising awareness surrounding social justice and economic justice issues. Arguably, administration and students have similar perspectives. However, without the pressure from student voices, administration would be much slower to implement change.
